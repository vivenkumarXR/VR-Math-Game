## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Unity (version 2021.3 or later recommended)
- XR Plugin Management for VR headset support
- TextMeshPro (already integrated in Unity)
- A VR headset with hand tracking capabilities (e.g., Oculus Quest or similar)

Importing the Project
Open Unity Hub.
Click Add and select the cloned project folder.
Open the project in Unity.



Configuring XR
Navigate to Edit > Project Settings > XR Plug-in Management.
Enable the XR plug-in for your target platform (e.g., Oculus, OpenXR).
Ensure your VR headset is connected and properly set up.



How to Play
Launch the game in your VR headset.
Follow the on-screen instructions:
To Start: Perform a Shaka gesture with your right hand.
Objective: Place cubes over the correct spheres to match the displayed result.
To Restart: Perform a left-hand thumbs-up gesture.
A timer will count down from 10 seconds. Solve the problem before time runs out!



Key Functions and Logic
Game Flow
Game Start: The game begins with the RaiseRightHandThumpsUp function in the FlowManager script.
Result Generation: A random result is generated using the GenerateResult method.
Cube Placement Validation: Playersâ€™ placements are validated via collision detection and logic in the CalculateValue function.



Gesture Detection
Hand gestures are tracked using the XR Hands SDK. Key gestures include:
Shaka Gesture: Starts the game.
Thumbs-Up Gesture: Restarts the game.
Timer
A countdown timer is implemented using coroutines in the FlowManager script. The timer dynamically updates in the UI.


Challenges and Creative Solutions
Gesture Recognition
Implementing reliable gesture recognition for specific hand gestures like Shaka required careful calibration of the hand-tracking SDK.

Real-Time Feedback
Integrating TextMeshPro for dynamic text updates helped improve the clarity of instructions and real-time feedback during gameplay.

Enhanced Immersion
Using a guided practice mode with animated hand models and visual cues allows new players to quickly grasp the game mechanics.




Future Enhancements
Add levels with increasing difficulty.
Implement multiplayer functionality for collaborative learning.
Enhance UI with additional visual feedback for gestures and correct/incorrect answers.
